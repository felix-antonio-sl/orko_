**1.1 Classification of the Book**

All methods presented in this book serve to optimize processes within the company. But  what significance and relevance do these methods have in terms of economic efficiency?  Do the methods also result in an increase in company value? This question will be exam ined in more detail below. The creation of value in the company can be measured via the  Economic Value Added (EVA.

As can be seen in Fig. 1.1, an economic value can only be created when the operating  profit (Net Operating Profit After Taxes) covers the capital costs. The capital costs are in  turn composed of the fixed assets and the Working Capital (WC) as well as the capital  cost rate. The lever for increasing company value with the methods of production optimi

zation lies in the area of Working Capital. Working Capital is defined as \[1\]: *WC* \= *cash and cash equivalents*\+*accounts receivable*\+*inventory*−*current liabilities*

Working Capital represents both a measure of liquidity, as current assets can usually  be quickly converted into liquid funds (unlike fixed assets), and a measure of a com pany’s financing needs. If the WC can be reduced, this leads to a reduction in financing  needs and thus to an improvement in capital profitability and improved interest expenses.  Based on the definition of WC, the lever of current assets can already be fixed, which  can be optimized through operational excellence. The aim is to achieve continuous value  enhancement through the application of Lean Management philosophy and the methods

of production optimization, thereby strengthening the company sustainably \[1, 2\]. The WC is primarily determined by processes that affect inventories, receivables and  liabilities. These processes are income management (Order-to-Cash), inventory manage ment (Total-Supply-Chain) and expenditure management (Purchase-to-Pay). The focus  below is on inventory management and the associated reduction of stocks. However, it

should be considered that a holistic view of the three processes listed must always be  taken to avoid isolated solutions. To minimize stocks, various intermediate goals can be  formulated. For example, with the help of SMED, the setup time can be shortened or  waste and scrap can be reduced by applying Poka Yoke. Also, existing transport routes,  warehouses and processes can be optimized through a value stream analysis to achieve a  reduction in stock \[1\].

In summary, it can be stated that suitable measures, some of which are presented in  the book, have a high influence on the economic efficiency of the company. Thus, the  inventory and consequently the Working Capital can be reduced. This results in the com pany’s capital costs decreasing and the company value being increased.

The book is divided into individual self-contained chapters, each presenting methods  for optimizing production structures.

Figure 1.2 illustrates the basic structure of the book. Kaizen, or the “change for the  better”, always operates within the tension or the target dimensions of improving lead  time, the functional flexibility of the production system, and the enhancement of product  quality. Lean Six Sigma provides tools and methods for this transformation to succeed.  The following chapters of the book particularly address methods and tools that are most  frequently used in industrial practice. Each chapter first explains the theoretical founda

tions, which are then to be tried out and practiced in practical “hands-on exercises”. The  tasks are designed for courses where the practical exercises can be carried out in small  groups. For the trainer/course leader, templates for tables, work tasks, stencils, and sug gested solutions are provided in the appendix of each chapter to support the practical  implementation and guidance of the participants.

**Shitsuke 25S—Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,**

**2.1 Classification of the Method**

5S is a Lean tool for systematically uncovering waste, named after the initial letters of  five Japanese terms \[1\]. The term 5S is usually associated with a tidy and organized  workplace and the assurance that this state is maintained \[2\].

However, it turns out (Fig. 2.1), that this representation of the goals of 5S is not  appropriate, because 5S is more than a method for creating order. 5S is a foundation of  every Lean management approach and a prerequisite for the application of the PDCA  methodology \[2–5\].

**2.2 Description of the Method**

The 5S system, or also referred to as 5A in German technical literature \[6\], can be  divided into the following components:

**Seiri:** Seiri (Sorting) describes the separation of necessary and unnecessary items at  the workplace. Material that is no longer needed is removed from the workplace. This  particularly refers to excessive circulating stocks as well as unnecessary, surplus and  defective tools, unnecessary machines, faulty parts as well as unneeded papers and docu

ments \[1, 6\]. The aim is to keep the workplace clear and avoid waste when searching for  a tool. This also increases the quality by avoiding damage to the product through the use  of the wrong tool \[4\].

**Seiton:** Seiton (Tidying up) describes the creation of a visible order that supports the  process. This includes providing the work equipment in perfect condition and ergonomi cally within reach at a defined and standardized place \[1\]. It is useful to mark the places,  as this way missing tools are noticed.

**Seiso:** Seiso (Keeping the workplace clean) describes the general cleanliness of the  workplace. Cleanliness allows errors to be detected more quickly and quality defects  due to dirt and foreign bodies to be avoided \[4\]. Signs of wear and tear on the operat ing equipment become immediately apparent and unplanned machine stops and costly  damage can be avoided. An orderly workplace therefore demonstrably leads to higher  employee satisfaction \[6\].

**Seiketsu:** The Japanese term Seiketsu refers to the standardization of work pro cesses in individual process steps \[1\]. New employees can be better trained through  prior standardization of the activity. The aim is for work instructions and processes to  become routine \[6\]. In the area of employee induction, Lean management follows a  different approach than the classic view. In the classic view, the employee is provided  with documents in addition to an induction, from which he can familiarize himself with  standards. The Lean management view is that a new employee is trained until he can  maintain the standard without documents. In the Western world, Seiketsu is often mis understood in terms of employee induction. Seiketsu is not intended to ensure the fastest  possible induction, but the highest possible quality of work and increased motivation of  the employee. The standardization of the activity within the framework of the CIP \[4\].

**Shitsuke:** As part of Shitsuke (always apply and improve), employees and managers  have to ensure that the achieved standards are not undercut. In addition, the continuous  improvement process should be initiated \[4\], by having employees develop suggestions  for eliminating Muda. 7 2.3 Workshop 1 “Kit Assembly”

**2.3 Workshop 1 “Kit Assembly”**

In the following section, the above-explained 5S will be demonstrated in an interactive  seminar through a simulation using a Lego kit. For this, it is necessary to complete three  practice runs in groups, each containing minor changes, in order to develop the theoreti

cal understanding in small steps and to illustrate the idea of optimization. In each round, a Lego kit must be assembled according to the instructions and the  required time must be measured. Once the first practice round is completed, the already  assembled Lego kit must be passed on to the next group and an unknown new Lego kit  must be assembled in the following practice round. The passing on after each individual  practice round and the associated new kit at the beginning of each round is intended to  better illustrate the optimization result, as this excludes a learning effect and the entire  optimization of the 5S methodology can be credited.

**2.3.1 Implementation**

**2.3.1.1  First Practice Run**

1\. Each group receives a box containing a mixed Lego kit. In addition to the kit, more –  not needed – Lego bricks and paper snippets are added, which are supposed to simu late a disordered and unclean environment.

2\. This kit must then be assembled according to the corresponding instructions  (Fig. 2.2).

3\. Furthermore, the required time must be measured using a stopwatch and entered into  a table (Fig. 2.3).

4\. Pass the kit on to the next group.

**2.3.1.2  Second Practice Run**

1\. In this run, all groups receive a box with prepared partitions – simple cardboard is  suitable here – to form 20 individual compartments.

**Fig. 2.3** Measurement table

2\. The box can then be filled with the individual Lego parts as preferred by the respec tive group. This sorting can be done, for example, according to required work steps,  colors, sizes, shape of the parts.

3\. Now the assembly of the parts begins as well as the measurement of the required  time.

4\. The time must again be entered into the table and the Lego kit passed on to the next  group.

5\. Subsequently, the improvements should be discussed and further solutions developed. **2.3.2 Blank Templates**

**Lean Six Sigma 3**

**3.1 Classification of the Method**

Lean Six Sigma is a combination of the goals and techniques of Lean Management and  the Six Sigma approach. It thus combines productivity-enhancing measures with quality focused measures, forming a holistic approach whose goal is to achieve higher success  through joint planning and enhancement of both sizes.

It shows that the demand for quality improvement (Fig. 3.1) and simultaneous cost  reduction does not have to be a contradiction. Errors and waste are eliminated through  a systematic and fact-based analysis of the processes. A targeted implementation of uni form measurement and project systematics increases customer satisfaction and company  value \[1–3\].

**3.2 Description of the Method**

As already shown in the classification, Lean Six Sigma is the combination of techniques  of the elements of Lean Management and Six Sigma. A core element is the DMAIC  cycle which is divided into five phases and provides a structured analysis process for a  defined problem. The phases are Define (D), Measure (M), Analyze (A), Improve (I),  and Control (C). This cyclical structure also ensures continuous improvement. Various  tools of Lean Management or Six Sigma can be used in each of these phases (Fig. 3.3).  The individual phases will now be presented in detail.

**3.2.1 Define Phase**

In the Define phase, the current situation is described and the goals and the problem are  precisely defined. In addition, the schedule and project organization should be deter mined. A uniform understanding of the Lean Six Sigma project should be created within  the entire team. Therefore, a detailed project contract should be created. An important  step in this phase is also to define customer requirements, as these are essential for pro ject success.

**3.2.1.1  VOC**

To define customer requirements, the first step is to capture the voice of the customer  (Voice of The Customer). This represents a completely unfiltered statement. The aim is  to make this statement measurable criteria up to the Project Ys, so that project success  can be measured later (Fig. 3.2). The voice of the customer can be determined through  market analyses or individual interviews.

The actual problem of the customer needs to be understood. This results in the cus tomer need. Subsequently, the customer’s requirements must be replaced with measur able output criteria. These are also called Critical to Quality (CTQ). This is a feature that  has a direct influence on the success of the output (e.g., product). If the voice of the cus

tomer is, for example, that it takes a very long time until an order release is made, a time  can be defined that may occur at most until the release has taken place.

**3.2.1.2  Project Contract**

At the end of the Define Phase, all information should be recorded in a condensed form  in a document. The company situation should be presented to legitimize the need for  the project. In addition, a precisely defined problem statement must be included. This  is essential for the later course of the project. Furthermore, a goal description should  be included. This should be recorded according to the SMART (Specific, Measurable,  Attainable, Relevant, Time bound) formula. The financial effect should also be defined,  and the exact project team with responsibilities should be named.

**3.2.2 Measure Phase**

The main goal of the phase is to determine the current state. This serves as the basis  for later process improvement. Critical measurement criteria must be selected and the  relevant data determined to evaluate success in meeting customer requirements \[5\]. The  quality of the data is crucial. This should be checked for its goodness with a measure

ment system analysis (MSA). 12 3 Lean Six Sigma

**3.2.2.1  Measurement System Analysis**

The collection of data for later analysis is carried out by trained individuals, based on  clear instructions and within the framework of uniform methods, using defined measur ing tools. This step is important as this procedure leads to a corresponding reliability of  the system and the data obtained from it. Before a measurement system can be used, it  must first be tested for reliability to rule out that the recorded data are not flawed. The  subsequent phases build on this data, thus false conclusions can be accordingly ruled out.  A measurement system analysis checks the following characteristics of a measurement  system \[4\]:

• Accuracy (“accuracy”),

• Stability (“stability”),

• Repeatability (“repeatibility”) and

• Reproducibility (“reproducibility”).

In addition to the criteria mentioned above, it is also necessary to check the Resolution  (resolution). The resolution refers to the smallest possible display difference of the meas uring device. It should be less than or equal to 5 % of the Tolerance in order to record the  quantity to be measured in sufficient detail \[6\]. An attributive measurement system anal ysis (MSA) is applied to discrete data. At least two appraisers and usually 30 numbered  parts to be analyzed are required. Care should be taken to include both good parts and  defective parts in the sample to be measured. Each appraiser must then measure all parts  contained in the sample twice, in a random order. After the measurement results have  been recorded, they are compared with the reference value. The goal of a good measure ment system analysis is a 100 % match, although a limit value of at least 90 % may be  sufficient \[2\].

**3.2.2.2  Process Capability Analysis**

The DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities) is a metric that describes the error rate  and is considered from a company’s perspective. The DPMO is defined as \[7\]:

*DPMO* \= *number of defects* *number of units* × *number of defect opportunities*× 106

The DPO (Defects Per Opportunities) can also be calculated later on, as this metric is  used to convert to the later Sigma level. This metric is defined as follows \[7\]:

*DPO* \= *number of defects* *number of units* × *number of defect opportunities*

If an evaluation is to be carried out primarily from the customer’s perspective, the PPM  (Parts Per Million) metric is used. It is defined as \[8\]:

*PPM* \= *number of defect units* *number of units*106

3.2 Description of the Method 13

If there is only one possibility of error—because there is only one characteristic—the  DPMO and PPM metrics are the same. For meeting customer demand, it is not crucial  whether a product has one or more defects, it is only important that the product is defect free. Therefore, the PPM metric is a customer-driven metric and is used in the automo tive industry as a requirement for suppliers. In contrast, the DPMO is used as an internal  metric because it offers a better comparison between different complex systems. This  results from the fact that the metric not only evaluates the number of defective units,  but also relates these to the possibilities of error. This allows for fine-tuning. However,  it should be noted that the error rate (DPMO) is the “softer” metric. This is because the  denominator, due to the number of error possibilities, which results from the multiplica tion of the number of units and the possible number of errors per unit, will always be sig nificantly larger than the denominator of the PPM. This, in turn, means that the overall  metric is always smaller than the PPM. Therefore, for the actual evaluation of the quality  level, the “sharper” metric—the PPM—is more suitable \[8\].

Not only with the determination and consideration of the DPMO and the PPM can  a statement be made about the quality capability of the process. To get a more accu rate assessment of the capability, the following process capability indices must be deter mined.

**3.2.2.3  Process Capability Indices**

The measure of process capability can be expressed with the metric cp. This evaluates  the reliability of a process to achieve the required goals. For this, the process spread is  related to the tolerance. This metric is also described by Töpfer as the dispersion index.

The dispersion index characterizes the basic suitability of a process to deliver values  with small dispersion in relation to the length of the tolerance interval. The metric can be  calculated by \[9, 10\]:

*process width* \= *upper spec limit* (*USL*) − *lower spec limit* (*LSL*) *cp* \= *specification width*

6σ

The disadvantage of the dispersion index is that it does not reflect the position of the  mean value. This can lead to the dispersion being kept within a narrow range (high cp value), but the process is still not specification-compliant. A high cp value is a necessary  but not sufficient condition to achieve a high process sigma value. For this, an additional  consideration of the process centering is required, which is described by the level index  cpk and thus represents the second metric for evaluating the process capability \[2\]. The  metric can be calculated as follows \[9, 10\]:

*cpk* \= min

*USL* − µ

3σ;µ − *LSL* 3σ

This metric thus describes the position of the mean value within the tolerance. If a mean  value shift of 1.5σ occurs, the level index changes, but the dispersion index does not.  This deteriorates from a cpk \= 2 (without shift) to cpk \= 1.5 (with shift). This means that 14 3 Lean Six Sigma

a cpk value of at least 1.5 must be achieved to meet the requirement of Six Sigma \[9, 10\].  Once the required measurements have been determined, the next step is to analyze them  in more detail.

**3.2.2.4  Sigma Level**

To determine the sigma level based on the determined metrics DPMO or DPO and PPM,  the error rate is converted into the yield (Yield).

Φ(*z*) \= (1 − *DPO*) \= (1 − 0, 8889) \= 0, 1111

This corresponds to a yield of 11 %

To determine the sigma level, the calculated Φ(*z*) value can now be read off using the  Z-table (Fig. 3.9).

The process sigma level is divided into Sigma Short Term and Sigma Long Term. The  difference between a short-term process capability (Sigma Short Term) and the long term process capability (Sigma Long Term) is based on the fact that the short-term value  does not take into account external influences \[4\]. This means that in the long term, a  process is less reliable because environmental influences or wear and tear are present.  Therefore, a sigma of 1.5 is added to the Long Term, which expresses the shift due to  unreliability. When determining via the DPMO, the table outputs the Sigma Long Term.  However, when calculating via the Z-table of the normal distribution, the Sigma Short  Term is determined \[11\].

**3.2.3 Analysis**

The objective of this phase can be described as follows.

Identify the root causes of the problem and then verify whether their resolution solves  the process problem \[5\].

To do this, the measured data must be structured, evaluated, analyzed, and assessed  \[12\]. This phase can be divided into two steps. First, the main influencing variables must  be found and then the cause-effect relationships must be determined and represented.  Qualitative and statistical methods can be used for this. At the end, the effects and causes  on the target variable must be known in order to develop them in the next phase \[8\].

• Pareto diagram,

• Flow diagrams,

• Control Charts,

**3.2.3.1  Pareto diagram** 15

The insights gained in the Measure phase can be graphically analyzed using a Pareto  diagram. This is a bar chart in which the individual values are arranged and cumulated  in size from left (largest value) to right (smallest value). This form of presentation allows  the existing resources to be focused on the essential influencing variables. This form of  analysis is based on the Pareto principle, according to which 80 % of the problems can  be traced back to 20 % of the causes \[13\].

**3.2.4 Improve**

In this phase, a review and concretization of the impact forecasts should be carried out  again, as the data basis was significantly improved in the previous phase. If the results  achieved do not reach the defined target level, the cycle must be run through again \[10\].

The goal of this phase is to recognize, evaluate, and select solutions for successful  optimization \[5\]. It must be determined how the process input variables and process  parameters, taking into account the disturbance variables, are to be set. The activities of  this phase also include testing the solution, checking its effectiveness, and the subsequent  sustainable implementation using action and measure plans \[8, 12\]. However, the solu

tion should be evaluated beforehand in terms of cost-benefit ratio, degree of difficulty,  time required for implementation, and possible risks \[14\].

**3.2.5 Control**

The goal of the final phase is to stabilize the optimized process and check the pursued  target level (Fig. 3.3) \[10\]. To monitor the process results and ensure them in the long  term, a control system is needed that directly recognizes deviations and initiates appro priate corrective measures. This can be done through internal audits of the quality man agement or in the form of previously created test plans \[12\]. In addition to the control  system, the cost savings should also be demonstrated by a before-and-after comparison,  using the optimized rejects. If the results are satisfactory, the findings must be communi cated throughout the company so that other projects can also benefit from them \[5\]. After  the project is completed, further improvement activities should be implemented to thus  directly enter the improvement process (CIP) \[10\]. 16 3 Lean Six Sigma

**3.3 Workshop 2: “Precision Origami”**

**Required Materials**

• Din-A4 sheets, possibly different colors

• Paper clip, possibly different colors

• Measuring template (appendix) 18 3 Lean Six Sigma **3.3.1 Implementation** The goal of the workshop is the creation of a “Precision Origami” (Fig. 3.5). As prepa ration, a SIPOC analysis was already carried out in the Define phase (Fig. 3.4), which  describes the process flow. There, the individual production steps are stored and again  illustrated in Fig. 3.5 to produce the final product. Figure 3.6 then shows the finished  product, in which the clip should also be attached. It is important to ensure during pro duction that, for example, a red clip is attached to a red product and a white one to a  white product, etc.

**3.3.2 Process Performance Analysis**

The participants can divide themselves into groups of three and each group is given a  certain number of sheets and paper clips. Then, within a given time of 5 min, each group  must produce precision origami according to the scheme in Fig. 3.5. Subsequently, the  quality of the produced parts (Fig. 3.7) is checked. The checks include whether

1\) the clip is attached in the correct place and orientation,

2\) the corner of the product is within the tolerance, made using the template shown in  Fig. 3.6,

3\) the sheet is heavily damaged.

As this is only a possible suggestion for quality defects, other defects such as damaged  sheets/clips etc. can certainly be considered.

The following tasks need to be completed:

1\) Error evaluation using an error collection card for each group.

2\) Use the total number of defective products **of all** groups to calculate the DPU and  DPO metrics and also within the individual groups.

3\) Determine the Sigma level (Long-Term and Short-Term value).

4\) Create a Pareto diagram based on the error collection cards in the respective groups. 5\) Develop optimization suggestions. 20 3 Lean Six Sigma

**3.4 Workshop 3: “Vegetable Cutter”**

In the course of a survey in a large-scale catering kitchen, it was found that the cut ting results of the fruit, vegetables, or sliced sausage to be chopped vary greatly. The  individual goods are cut into slices with an ordinary kitchen knife to cover bread slices  for breakfast. A uniform thickness of the slices is desired, but so far this has only been  achieved insufficiently. Customers complain either about slices that are too thick (“The  sausage is then too thick for me and I don’t like that.”) or about slices that, due to too lit tle slice thickness and poor execution of the cutting process, only result in incomplete or  crooked slices. To increase customer satisfaction, a survey of customers regarding their  quality requirements was conducted. With these data, the DMAIC cycle is now being  carried out to improve the given process. The further results of the survey have been  recorded in the DEFINE phase. Further conditions for the improvement project result  from the specifications of the project sponsor (Fig. 3.11).

***Required Materials***

This requires a solution that can be reconstructed as simply as possible using the sim plest means and that requires as little financial expenditure as possible. In the appendix,  you will find forms and work instructions to carry out the process through the DMAIC  phases. 22 3 Lean Six Sigma

**3.4.1 Define Phase**

The implementation of the phase is explained based on the contents of the project char ter. A blank form as well as a document filled with all contents of the DEFINE phase is  shown in Fig. 3.14.

***Problem Statement***

The problem in this project is the inconsistent slice thickness after the cutting process.  Often slices are too thick or so thin that no whole slices can be handed over. The custom ers are directly affected by this problem, as they may not like the slices that are too thick  or slices that are too thin are not suitable for covering and serving. The problem can be  narrowed down to the actual cutting process, as this is where the inconsistent slice thick nesses occur.

***Voice of The Customer***

The primary goal of the project is to meet the customer’s desire for consistently thin  slices of food. As further conditions, the customers have stipulated that an ordinary  kitchen knife must be used for the cut, as it is used in various locations and there is no  space for large fixtures or cutting machines. Furthermore, the improvement solutions  should not represent a major financial burden, as the budget is very limited. The pro

cess should also proceed as quickly as before and not generate increased cleaning efforts.  With regard to the critical quality indicators, the customer requirements can now be con verted into measurable sizes (QTC). For this purpose, the form for the VOC translation  matrix in Fig. 3.12 can be used. 23 3.4 Workshop 3: “Vegetable Cutter”

***Goal Statement***

On the one hand, the slice thickness (Critical to Quality) should not exceed 8 mm with a  sufficient sigma level, as this is the highest value still acceptable to customers. Further more, the slice thickness should not fall below 1 mm, so that there is no risk of produc ing incomplete slices. The costs (Critical to Cost) should not exceed 2 €. The size of the  improvement solution must fit into a storage space twice the size (Critical to Quality)  of the kitchen knife. The duration (Critical-to-Time) including cleaning should not take  longer than the current process (Fig. 3.12).

***Time Frame***

Due to the simplicity of the project, one week per DMAIC phase is scheduled as the time  frame.

**3.4.2 Measure Phase**

With the information and quality metrics captured in the process charter, the current  process can be examined in terms of the objective. For this purpose, a data collection  plan was created in Fig. 3.13. Here it is determined which critical data (CTQ), when,  how, where, and how often are collected. The duration of the cutting process of a whole  cucumber is recorded. To determine the variation of inconsistent slice thickness, a sam

ple of cutting processes on three whole cucumbers (150 slices) is measured and doc umented using a calibrated caliper. Based on this data, an initial process performance  evaluation and determination of the sigma level are carried out. 24 3 Lean Six Sigma

**Fig. 3.13** Data collection plan for the measurements

**3.4.3 Analyze Phase**

The project does not incur any costs (except labor and opportunity costs), as both the  test object (cucumber) and the knife are already available in the kitchen. The dimensions  of the knife in our example are 21.5 cm in length and 2 cm in maximum width. With  this knowledge, the target specifications for the small transport size can be specified and  included in the project charter as a target value. The process time in seconds showed no  significant fluctuations over 15 % and was always within the usual process duration.

The measured values of the slice thicknesses can be appropriately displayed in a his togram to obtain the variation of the slice thicknesses around a mean value and to calcu late the process performance parameters, as described in the theory part.

**3.4.4 Improve Phase**

To reduce the identified errors by positioning and guiding the blade, potential solutions  were generated in the next step using a brainstorming session. A form for your own  brainstorming is shown in Fig. 3.20.

**3.4.5 Control Phase**

At the end of the DMAIC cycle, all measurement results, documentation, and forms can  now be handed over to the Process Owner. All critical quality metrics have been demon strably achieved and the developed solution can now be applied. Aspects of change

management should be considered, as the customer is not yet familiar with the “rustic”  design and the changed cleaning process of the spacer. The data collection plan should  be carried out at regular intervals to validate whether the distance of the spacer to the  blade is still appropriate and has not been adjusted, as this would again cause process  variations.

After conducting the brainstorming, the idea of a spacer (Fig. 3.21), which is attached  to the knife and thus takes up little storage space in terms of the objectives, came up  in addition to expensive and complicated measures. All ideas were reflected in terms of  meeting all critical target specifications, but only the idea of the spacer could meet all  criteria in theory. A spacer shown in the practical example can be realized inexpensively.  The slice thicknesses should be more consistent due to the similar structure as with a  planer or a stop. The identified approach should therefore first be tested in a pilot trial or  when experimenting with a prototype.

By practicing a suitable cutting technique in conjunction with the prototypes of a  spacer, the values could each be improved.

The spacer was attached slightly below the cutting edge, so that the knife can be  applied without a cut having to be made already. The spacer is limited to a fixed distance  from the blade, which defines the slice thickness. For larger distances, however, paper  (possibly folded) can be inserted between the cable tie and wooden skewer to increase  and adjust the targeted slice thickness. The maximum width of the device and knife is  2.8 cm, which meets the target specification for transport size. Only minor material val

ues were expended.

**3.5 Workshop 4: “Precision Throw”**

A standard table tennis ball is repeatedly thrown by hand into an empty wastebasket  from a distance of 1 m. In doing so, different and unpredictable effects occur. Not only  does the table tennis ball bounce just in front of or behind the wastebasket at regular  intervals, thus missing the target, but there is also a left or right spin in the flight behav

ior of the table tennis ball. The flight behavior of the table tennis ball also depends heav ily on the person making the throw. Thus, different approaches to the throwing technique  can emerge, which vary greatly due to factors such as experience, body size, or cognitive 26 3 Lean Six Sigma

**3.5.1 Define Phase**

The placement of the table tennis ball in the wastebasket should succeed from a distance  of 1 m, regardless of the different characteristics of the participating individuals. The aim  is to achieve the highest possible hit rate, which corresponds to the 6σ level and does not  allow any conclusions about possible criteria such as experience, body size, or cogni

tive abilities of the participating individuals. The current process execution leaves too  much room for error, endangering the target-oriented throw of the table tennis ball into  the wastebasket. The hitting of the wastebasket depends heavily on the individual char acteristics of the throwing person, which directly influences the flight curve of the table  tennis ball. The transfer of the requirements into the project charter should not only rep resent the framework conditions, but also be used to show the most significant objectives  using the SMART approach (Fig. 3.22). 31 3.5 Workshop 4: “Precision Throw”

**SPECIFIC MESSBAR ACCEPTED REALISTIC TERMINATED**

A table tennis ball should hit the wastepaper basket from a distance of 1m, regardless of the person. At 1 million A empts should not exceed 3.4 Table tennis

balls land outside the wastepaper basket. The aim of process

improvement is to achieve the 6-sigma level via the DMAIC cycle. The process should be developed using

generally available

tools. The implementa on of the process improvement should be

completed by date x.

**Fig. 3.22** Defined target criteria according to SMART

The goal statement thus includes the most essential aspects of improvement and also  underlines the importance for successful implementation and the deadline to be met. In  addition to achieving the 6σ level, achieving the best possible grade is also a high prior ity. The problem statement is primarily characterized by hitting the wastebasket from a  distance of 1 m or the desired separation between the throwing process and the char acteristics of the participating person. The miss rate should not exceed 3.4 misses per  1 million attempts. (Fig. 3.23). A proposed solution is attached in the appendix. The  schedule also provides a visual or temporal orientation in calendar weeks. This allows  the defined work steps to be delimited in time and at the same time gives the respective  completion date.

Describing the initial situation and specifying the project scope round off the project  charter. Here, by clarifying the student background and limiting the extent, the project  task is fixed. In addition, a process improvement cooperation with the table tennis ball  or wastebasket manufacturers and the dealers is categorically excluded. The focus is  exclusively on the endeavor to achieve a sustainable throwing process optimization and  to increase the hit rate.

To get an overview of the current process situation, a clear designation of the pro cesses using SIPOC (Fig. 3.24) is required.

The suppliers have an equally significant influence on the specification or material  properties of the table tennis ball or wastebasket. For example, dealers can have a signifi cant impact on the product properties of the table tennis ball and the wastebasket through  incorrect picking or storage methods. Therefore, the expected properties of the table ten nis ball and the wastebasket are also among the inputs of the process execution. These  are expanded by the throwing technique and the weather conditions. For example, wind  conditions have a direct influence on the flight curve. 32 3 Lean Six Sigma **Fig. 3.23** Project charter—precision throw table tennis ball into wastebasket

The process flow can be reduced to five essential steps.

1\. Placing the wastebasket on the ground, which has no inclination/slope. 2\. Grabbing the table tennis ball: the palm of the hand is cleaned and neither sticky,  moistened, or otherwise disadvantageously soiled.

3\. Taking a distance of 1 m to the wastebasket.

3.5 Workshop 4: “Precision Throw”

4\. Starting the aiming process. 5\. Executing the throw. 33

The last two process executions are thus strongly dependent on the person, as, for exam ple, the interpretation of the distance and the required force can vary from person to  person. The exact hitting of the wastebasket or missing the wastebasket can thus be iden tified as the output of the process executions. In this case, the thrower takes on the role  of the customer. He aims to ensure the successful placement of the table tennis ball while  adhering to the processes to be carried out.

**3.5.2 Measure Phase**

The evaluated measurement data in the Measure Phase should enable a revealing iden tification of the problem extent to be eliminated. Here, the placement of the table tennis  ball in the wastebasket is to be seen as an unchangeable size. In addition, the throw ing distance of 1 m to be maintained and the wastebasket dimensions, which are mainly  characterized by the wastebasket height of 36 cm and the wastebasket diagonal of 28 cm,  must be taken into account. To measure the hit or miss rate as accurately as possible, it is

advisable to use a cardboard device that records the impact of the table tennis ball. The cardboard device coated with flour serves the purpose of capturing the impact  of the table tennis ball (Fig. 3.25a,c). The trail left by the table tennis ball serves as a  reference point for distance determination. Thus, using a measuring device, the distance  between the impact point of the table tennis ball and the center, marked with a *black  cross* in Fig. 3.25b,c, can be measured in cm. In addition to the possible deviation to the  center, the lower and upper specification limits can also be determined. The lower specification limit is thus 86 cm away from the throwing position. The  upper specification limit, on the other hand, is 114 cm away from the throwing position  (Fig. 3.26). For a more reliable interpretation, however, the number of throws must be  increased and the documentation care improved. Here, the data collection sheet (attached  as a blank form in the appendix) should enable a clean listing of the throwing processes.  The number of throwing processes is set at 100 throwing processes to make a more accu rate statement about the process.

The data collection sheet summarizes the attempts made, the respective throw ing results, and the respective distance achieved. The most important key data are also  listed at the top right edge to be able to immediately classify the distance achieved in the  throwing attempt. The results of the data collection sheet can then be evaluated using a  histogram.

Using the DPO or PPM calculation from the theory, the current Six Sigma value can  be calculated in the next step. 34 3 Lean Six Sigma **Fig. 3.25a–c** Recording device for deviation determination

To describe the interaction between the miss rate and the possible causes, the use of the  Ishikawa diagram is suitable. By dividing the causes into the classes environment, mate rial, human, and method, the most significant causes should be listed (solution proposal  in the appendix).

**3.5.4 Improve Phase**

The process improvements are now derived from the analysis. It is advisable to con trol or eliminate the causes induced by humans and the methodology, possibly through  standardization in the form of a device. The errors induced by the material could be  reduced by a material test using a small scale and a measuring device before the throw.  In addition, sufficient lighting conditions and the selection of a wind-free zone should be  ensured.

3.5 Workshop 4: “Precision Throw” 35

The development of a catapult device and the experiment in a closed room could help  to significantly increase the hit rate. Instructions for construction are included in the  appendix.

**3.5.5 Control Phase**

In order to apply the developed process improvement methods sustainably and standard ized, continuous process documentation must be introduced. One of the most important  factors in fixing the process steps is maintaining the distance to the wastebasket. The  distance of 1 m can be determined using a ruler and marked. The second important fac tor is the attachment of the rubber band. It should be noted that a distance of 3 cm must  be maintained between the outermost edge of the catapult ramp and the bonding point of  the rubber band. In the next step, the catapult ramp must be pulled down to the stop. The  data sheet can be used again to check the process performance. The continuous recal culation of the DPO and PPM allows the improvement to be continuously checked and  consolidated.

**3.5.6 Appendix: Suggested Solution and Blank Templates**

Suggested solution to the Ishikawa Diagram (Fig. 3.27).

Methodological causes include incorrectly chosen throwing processes or inappropri ate “running up”. In the human class, the lack of a fine feeling for the necessary throwing  force, body size, dirty or sticky hands, and a misjudgment of the distance to the waste basket play a major role. Deviating material properties of the table tennis ball, mainly  characterized by weight and volume, also influence the course of the throw. Poor lighting  conditions, an unpredictable gust of wind, and barriers that are in the throwing path or  near the thrower directly interfere with the throwing process.

Suggested solution and blank form Project Charter (Fig. 3.28).

Blank form Data Collection Sheet (Experiment Series 1–50) (Fig. 3.29). Blank form Data Collection Sheet (Experiment Series 51–100) (Fig. 3.30). Construction instructions for the catapult (Fig. 3.31).

By rolling up the blank papers and then taping them with adhesive tape, the paper  rolls gain their stability. A total of 6 x 21 cm, 2 x 15 cm and 3 x 10.5 cm long paper  rolls are needed. The adhesive spots are characterized by the *blue dotted markings*. The  rubber attachment point must be placed in the middle. The lever movement allows a 4  cm long paper roll, attached under the rubber attachment point. The developed catapult  device significantly increases the hit rate. 36 3 Lean Six Sigma Environment Machine Method Ligh ng

In this workshop, a reliable process is to be developed to remove a defined portion of  spaghetti from a standard plastic packaging. Because depending on how the packaging  is manually torn open or, for example, cut open with scissors, the size of the amount of  spillage (Fig. 3.32) varies.

In the practical part, the basic principles and tools of Six Sigma and the DMAIC cycle  presented in the theory are to be applied practically using a simplified example. For this,  the required materials are first listed and the practical example is presented (Fig. 3.33).  Subsequently, the practical problem is to be made more process-reliable using the phases  of the DMAIC cycle with a tool. It can also be seen that the size of the outline can vary  greatly without precise specifications and accordingly high different quantities per pack

aging are dispensed solely due to the opening.

**Required Materials**

The core of the practical example is the spaghetti, of which at least one package is  needed, but several packages allow for slight variance in execution (e.g., different tearing  of the package). All other materials can be assigned to the following three functions: 40 3 Lean Six Sigma **Fig. 3.32** Outline of packaging when opening and varying amount of spillage

**Fig. 3.33** Overview of required materials 41 3.6 Workshop 5: “Spaghetti Dispenser”

• Objects for measurement: kitchen scale and a large glass or similar containers, stop watch;

• Objects for the process-optimizing tool: Large reusable bottle (preferably high  length), nut-nougat cream lid, cardboard (e.g., inside of the nut-nougat cream lid),  thumbtack, and adhesive tape;

• Objects for developing the tool: scissors, knife, pen, and a measuring tape.

**3.6.1 Define Phase**

To narrow down the process in this simplified workshop, the amount between one “tilt”  of a standard packaging and the single tilt with the support of the tool to be developed is  to be compared. With the help of the DMAIC cycle, the presented practical example is to  be improved process-wise and, for example, the process variations are to be reduced with  a tool to be developed.

First, the framework of the project is recorded and precisely defined in the Project  Charter. In addition to the key data such as the project title, project number, location,  etc., the exact problem definition and the project goal are formulated. In addition, the  benefits, a rough milestone plan, and the project team are defined in the Project Charter.

The project goal is to increase the process capability. However, to further specify and  make this measurable, an exact target quantity in grams and a customer specification  range are defined. An average amount of pasta per person is 55–75 g. In this project, the  target value is therefore set at 70 g and a specification limit of \+/− 5 g.

In a further step, the process to be examined is divided into five subprocess steps as  part of the SIPOC analysis (Fig. 3.34).

The process to be optimized starts with opening the pasta packaging and ends with  either putting the pasta into the cooking pot or closing and storing the pasta packaging.  However, the focus of the workshop is on the undefined amount of removal and the read justment, which can lead to high process variations.

In addition to breaking down the process steps, the SIPOC analysis can also deter mine the supplier (e.g., the buyer) or the customer (e.g., the cook) as well as the associ ated inputs and outputs, which are relevant in the following for determining customer  requirements and the derived Critical-to-Quality (CtQ).

**3.6.2 Measure Phase**

At the beginning of the Measure phase, the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) should  be applied to filter and refine the output criteria in terms of customer needs. The aim  here is to identify the relevant quality characteristics that will be measured in the further  course of the phase and then sustainably improved within the framework of the DMAIC  cycle. 42 3 Lean Six Sigma

Fig. 3.35 shows the House of Quality within the framework of Quality Function  Deployment, applied to the practical problem. The *differently colored fields* represent dif ferent functions in the form:

• *Green:* Customer requirements such as the correct amount of spaghetti and the short est possible processing time;

• *Yellow:* Weighting of the customer requirement;

• *Purple:* Quality-critical characteristics for meeting customer requirements; 43 3.6 Workshop 5: “Spaghetti Dispenser”

• *Gray:* Target values for the quality characteristics;

• *Orange:* Relationship matrix, which indicates the degree of fulfillment of customer  requirements by the quality-critical characteristics;

• *Blue:* Interactions among the characteristics.

To understand the QFD, the form is exemplified by the customer requirement for the cor rect amount of spaghetti. This has the highest weighting as the main requirement in the  practical problem and is influenced by the characteristic of the gram number. A target  value of 70 g per withdrawal was set, which is only fulfilled to a small degree according  to the relationship matrix. In the roof of the House of Quality, there is a possible colli sion for the characteristic of the gram number with the throughput time, as the correct  amount often requires time-consuming readjustment. Analogously, the form can also be  read for the other customer requirements. It becomes apparent that the relevant require ments are not met in the process with the conventional packaging.

After the customer requirements have been identified and weighted using QFD and  related to the relevant characteristics, these can now be measured in the main part of the  Measure phase. It is important that not as many criteria as possible, but the right output  criteria are measured. Of high importance is especially to get the right amount of spa

ghetti and possibly also the processing time. Therefore, the gram amount will be focused  on during the measuring process first.

During the measuring process, the spaghetti is tipped out of the packaging with a  push. The amount that is pushed out of the packaging during this tipping can then be  weighed in a container (e.g., a large glass or a measuring cup) on a kitchen scale. The  kitchen scale must be set in advance so that the weight of the container is not included  in the gram number of the measurement. A blank form and a suggested solution can be  found in the appendix.

In another measurement attempt, an additional parameter is examined: the throughput  time. For this purpose, the time required to achieve the required target quantity by read justment is measured using a stopwatch. To further delimit the process to be measured,  an already opened spaghetti package should be taken and the time should be stopped  from the moment of tipping until the correct amount of spaghetti is displayed in the  measuring container on the kitchen scale.

Fig. 3.36 shows the measurement of the throughput time. Here too, it becomes clear  that the assumed target duration of less than 10 seconds is not achieved with the existing  packaging.

As can be seen from the measurements of the gram number and the throughput time,  the required target values are not achieved in both cases and a high scatter is noticeable.  The process capability is therefore not given under the defined conditions and should be  analyzed and improved in the long term. However, the sigma level will only be calcu

lated for the gram number as the central quality characteristic in the following. 44 3 Lean Six Sigma

**3.6.3 Analyze Phase**

The data collected in the Measure Phase should be examined in the Analyze Phase for  causes of process quality reduction. The Ishikawa Diagram helps to identify and evaluate  possible influencing factors based on the six M. Fig. 3.37 shows the Ishikawa Diagram  related to the question “Why is the variation in the amount of spaghetti when tipping par

ticularly high?”. The influence from the categories machine and nature can be neglected  here, as no potential causes of error result from this in the practical problem. Possible  error influences arise from the measurement, for example if the kitchen scale is incor rectly calibrated and the weight of the measuring container is incorrectly included. The  material of the packaging can also lead to a sequence of errors in the question under  investigation, as the packaging easily tears. With regard to the methods, a more precise  specification for opening the packaging would have to be available in order to create a  smaller measurement scatter. However, the main cause in the practical example is the  human factor, as this exerts a different force when tipping and the inclination when tip

ping can vary greatly, so that the variation in the amount of spaghetti is very high. Another method of the Analyze Phase is the already introduced FMEA, which fur ther specifies the possible influencing factors from the Ishikawa Diagram and categorizes  them with a Risk Priority Number (RPN). A crucial difference is that the sources of error  are also prioritized by the RPN according to importance, detection probability and occur rence probability. A proposed solution and a blank form can be found in the appendix.

**3.6.4 Improve-Phase**

Human inaccuracy and a lack of methodology were identified as the main causes of  error based on the Ishikawa diagram and the FMEA. These need to be improved in the  Improve phase. 45 3.6 Workshop 5: “Spaghetti Dispenser”

In the exemplary FMEA form, the development of a device or tool was already deter mined as a countermeasure for possible errors. The Poka-Yoke approach was considered in  the development of the tool. Since the Poka-Yoke method also aims to eliminate randomly  occurring errors, which often arise from human actions as a source of influence, it is suitable  for the present practical problem. The goal is therefore to develop a tool for spaghetti removal  that does not allow human inaccuracy in the first place, so that strong process scattering can not occur. Various creativity techniques can be used to develop this tool (e.g., brainstorm ing). According to the task of this work, only common household items should be used in the  development of the tool. As a result, the prototype was created, which is shown in Fig. 3.38.

Here, a plastic bottle was cut open and used as a container for the spaghetti, which can  hold about three times the amount of the usual 500 g package. The heart of the tool is the  head glued on with adhesive tape, which is supposed to regulate the amount of spaghetti  ejected. For this purpose, the lid of a nut-nougat jar was used, as it fits well onto the cut end  of the bottle in terms of geometry and is made of a more stable plastic that does not deform  when tipping due to the spaghetti. To enable a process-safe exit quantity of the spaghetti, a  hole was first cut in the middle of the lid, which corresponds approximately to the circum

ference of 70 g of spaghetti. However, in order for the same amount to always be able to  exit, the container had to always be completely filled. As an iterative improvement, another  lid was therefore used, in which the hole was cut out elongated at the edge of the lid.

In addition, Fig. 3.38 also shows the lid closure. With the help of a piece of card board (e.g., contained in the nut-nougat lid) and a thumbtack, a kind of turntable can be  integrated on the lid, which allows the tool to be opened and closed. Thus, the spaghetti  should also be able to be stored quickly and easily closed with this. 46 3 Lean Six Sigma **Fig. 3.38** Prototype for process improvement

The firmly defined hole in the dimensionally stable lid should always allow the same  amount of spaghetti to exit when tipping the container, so that inaccuracies due to human  actions have no influence on the quantity. The harder material also does not tear com pared to the previously used spaghetti packaging, thus preventing a potential source of  error. To check the effectiveness of the tool, a measurement process is carried out again,  in which both the gram number of the exiting spaghetti and the throughput time of the  process are measured.

When comparing the mean values and standard deviations between the measurements  with the tool and the commercially available packaging, it becomes clear that the process  capability could be greatly increased. As before, the Cp and Cpk values were calculated  for this series of measurements, leading to a higher sigma level (in our example, just  under 2σ). The mean values correspond to the defined target values and are within the  permissible specification limits. Thus, the customer requirements are met.

**3.6.5 Control-Phase**

After the process has been defined, measured, analyzed, and effectively improved in the  previous phases of the DMAIC cycle, the last phase is about the sustainability of the pro cess. It must therefore be ensured that the newly developed tool is actually always used

3.6 Workshop 5: “Spaghetti Dispenser” 47

and that in the long term the spaghetti is not taken directly from the commercially avail able packaging again.

For long-term compliance with the improved process, a visualized procedure instruc tion is useful, for example. The process documentation of the optimized state with the  newly gained knowledge and a before-and-after description also contributes to the pro cess being adhered to in the long term.

If other or new process quality reductions occur in the long term, which negatively  influence the result and the process capability, the DMAIC cycle can be run through  again to iteratively eliminate these influences. Otherwise, at the end of this phase, the  process is handed back to the process owner and the project is completed.

***Proposed Solution and Blank Form for Measurement Implementation Proposed Solution for Measuring Throughput Time*** **(Fig. 3.41)**

For the measurement, three different spaghetti packages were used, each opened differ ently. This leads to different measurement scopes or different averages between the pack ages. Overall, the measurements show an average of 114 g with a standard deviation of  49 g. The target quantity of 70 g and the assumed specification limits for the customer  of \+/−5 g are thus not achieved. Based on the average μ and the standard deviation σ as well as the upper and lower specification limit, the Cp value and the Cpk value can be  calculated, and the sigma level could then be determined from a table.

the very low values, no sigma level can be determined in this example, as even the lowest  level of the 1σ level only starts at a Cp value of 0.33.

***Proposed solution for the FMEA*****analysis (Fig. 3.45)**

The example shows that errors resulting from different inclinations or force exertion  during tilting are particularly highly prioritized and therefore urgently need a correc tive action. For other errors with a lower RPZ, a corrective action can sometimes be  dispensed with, as resources would otherwise be wasted. Depending on the project and  company, the threshold for the RPZ that should lead to corrective actions can be chosen  differently.

**3.7 Workshop 6: “T-Shirt Folding Board”**

A daily process is the folding of clothes. Challenges can be posed by special T-shirts and  sweaters, as they are difficult to fold precisely. This not only results in wrinkled cloth ing, but also a messy appearance in the wardrobe. With the DMAIC process, a reliable  process should be developed with which T-shirts can always be folded and stored in the  same dimensions.

**Required Materials**

• Cardboard:

– 5 parts: (80 × 20, 80 × 20, 30 × 25, 30 × 25, 20 × 25),

– Middle part (30 × 25 cm),

– Upper part (30  × 25 cm),

– Lower part (20 × 25 cm),

– Right side part (80 × 20 cm),

– Left side part (80 × 20 cm).

• Adhesive tape, scissors and/or cutter knife, folding rule,

• Pen (markings), optionally five different colored pens.

The two side parts can also be made from two different parts if no cardboard of 80 cm  length is available. 53 3.7 Workshop 6: “T-Shirt Folding Board”

**3.7.1 Define Phase**

The SMART approach should be used to define the goals.

• **S**pecific: concrete naming of the process in which the problem occurs. • **M**easurable: The problem must contain at least one operational measurement size. • **A**greed: Same understanding of goals and problems by champion and team. • **R**ealistic: Project goal is achievable within a defined period.

• **T**imed: A defined schedule for achieving the goal.

The clothing should be evenly folded, i.e., have the same dimensions when folded, so  that it can be stacked neatly on top of each other. The dimensions of 30 cm × 25 cm with  a tolerance of one centimeter each have been defined as the goal for this.

**3.7.2 Measure Phase**

In the Measure phase, it must now be defined how exactly the process result can be  measured. The edges of the folded garment are selected as the measurement size.  Because if these are straight and the same length for each garment, this would mean a  neatly folded garment. The result can simply be measured using a yardstick to be able  to assess to what extent the process result varies. For this purpose, a total of 20 tops are  folded and measured by hand. A simple recording form is used to record the results. This  is attached in the appendix as a proposed solution as well as a blank form.

In conclusion of the Measure phase, it can be noted that the current manual process  does not particularly well meet the requirements and results in a large variation of the  folding results.

**3.7.3 Analyze Phase**

The Analyze phase is now about analyzing the collected measurements. Each aspect  must be examined so that the main causes can be derived from this information. This can  create a basis from which an improvement can be worked out in the Improve phase.

With the help of a process analysis, the folding process is broken down into its indi vidual parts to identify potential causes. The folding process can be divided into 5 steps,  which are then examined for potential sources of error. A proposed solution and a blank  form are attached in the appendix for this analysis. As a result, the potential sources of  error that led to this process result become apparent. 54 3 Lean Six Sigma **3.7.4 Improve Phase** After the causes of the problem have been identified, the Improve phase is now about  generating a solution, refining it, and implementing it. The so-called Poka-Yoke principle  can be considered for this. The preventive approach of implementing a new method so  that errors in folding clothes cannot occur in the first place would be an effective solution  to avoid errors.

Approaches for an improved mechanism emerge from the Analyze phase. The solu tion must ensure that the sleeves are always folded straight at the same position. This  also applies to folding lengthwise.

From these prerequisites, the idea of a folding board was developed, with which the  garments can always be folded to the same dimensions. This can be relatively easily real ized via cardboard cutouts that are connected with adhesive tape. The center part of the  folding board can be defined as 30 cm × 25 cm according to the target specification  (Define phase).

In order to be able to fold larger garments as well, the folding board has dimensions  of 80 cm × 65 cm. Accordingly, the two foldable side parts of the board have dimen sions of 80 cm × 20 cm. All individual parts were attached to the center part with con ventional adhesive tape. The construction instructions for the folding board are in the  appendix.

In order to be able to fold the garments to the desired dimensions of 30 cm × 25 cm,  two folding processes in length are required for a total length of the T-shirts and sweat ers. The sequence of the individual folding steps is shown in the appendix.

A potential source of error remains that the garment is placed crooked and uneven on  the folding board at the beginning of the process. To counteract this, colored markings  were drawn on both side parts. This way, it can be immediately recognized if the T-shirt  is not correctly placed on the board.

After the T-shirts have been folded using the folding board according to this process,  they have the desired dimensions of 30 cm × 25 cm. In our example, the dimensions of  all garments after folding with the folding board were within the required tolerance.

**3.7.5 Control Phase**

In order to establish the process sustainably, the measurements must be repeated and  documented at random, but at regular intervals.

**Poka Yoke 4**

**4.1 Classification of the Method**

By enforcing the One-Piece-Flow and the desire to be able to produce flawlessly, it is  necessary to make the manufacturing processes more reliable and to reduce errors. The  goal of the Poka-Yoke method is to prevent errors in assembly in particular through an  appropriate process design. The method follows the principle of error source preven

tion—since no errors can occur without an error source.

Together with the production evolution towards Lean Management, the Poka-Yoke  method was invented in Japan in 1961 by Shigeo Shingo. Shigeo Shingo was a quality  engineer at Toyota who coined Poka Yoke through the term Poka Yoke \[1\]. Baka Yoke  translates as “foolproof” and quickly spread in organizations like the Arakawa Body  Company.

An employee of the Arakawa Body Company, who was told that her workplace was  “foolproof”, found the term derogatory and the term was renamed Poka Yoke “avoidance  of unintentional errors” \[2\].

Lean Management is characterized by Kaizen and the avoidance of “Muda” (Waste).  Figure 4.1 shows the three essential drivers for successful production—it can be seen  that Poka Yoke is classified in terms of product quality compared to other process opti mization methods \[3\]. The essential factors for successful production listed in Fig. 4.1 do condition each other, but are not negatively correlated. While it is possible to improve  the quality of products by accepting a longer throughput time, both factors can also be  optimized equally through the use of the right methods and an appropriate management  approach. Furthermore, Poka Yoke can contribute to increased throughput time through  the approach of error source prevention, as potential rework becomes obsolete.

**4.2 Description of the Method**

The Zero-Error-Production aimed at by Shigeo Shingo through the application of Poka  Yoke is based on a basic idea with three components \[4\]:

1\. ***Cause Analysis:***

In the cause analysis, the process is checked in advance for possible incorrect actions  and not resulting errors for their causes. Due to the analysis of the actions with regard  to errors, a higher avoidance of errors is possible.

2\. ***100% Inspection:***

Through the implementation of the Poka Yoke, all parts in a process are checked for  certain potential incorrect actions, or the process is designed in such a way that the  incorrect action does not occur. Due to the simplicity of the facilities, it is also eco

nomically possible to check each individual part and not just a sample. 3\. ***Immediate Corrective Actions:***

Because the system is designed in such a way that errors are not allowed, the ini tiation of necessary corrective measures takes place immediately. Furthermore, Wil demann divides Poka Yoke into three subsystems, which allow the discovery and  reporting of incorrect actions to follow one another in time \[5\]. 4.2 Description of the Method**4.2.1 Detection Mechanism** 63

The testing method serves to describe the time and place of error and cause detection.  Within the detection mechanisms, the causes for the incorrect actions must also be deter mined in the context of an error source check. The basic principle of the error source  check is to prevent, for example, a wrong or defective/faulty material from reaching a  work step.

For this purpose, checks with direct and indirect feedback are suitable. In the case of  direct feedback (self-control), the employee actively recognizes the incorrect action and  can correct it. For example, a component can be dimensioned in such a way that it can  only be assembled in one orientation, or screws are to be dimensioned in such a way that  they differ both in length and in diameter.

In the case of indirect feedback (subsequent control), the next process step cannot be  carried out before the error has been corrected. An example of this would be that the  weight or dimensions of a workpiece are checked by a worker.

**4.2.2 Trigger Mechanism**

Trigger mechanisms ensure the detection of errors within the framework of a tar get-actual comparison. In this process, the characteristics and details of the error are  described by a contact method, a fixed value method, and a sequence of steps method.

In the contact method, the error is usually detected via geometric properties, e.g., by  sensors that can detect deviations in weight, temperature, or position, but also time. The fixed value method describes the testing for errors upon reaching a certain num ber of partial work steps. The partial work steps can be controlled, for example, by  mechanical or electronic counting devices. For instance, forgotten parts can be deter mined in assembly by the number of parts.

With the sequence of steps approach, incorrect actions are detected through a con trol of movement or action sequences, and if necessary, a regulatory mechanism is initi ated. A common example of a sequence of steps approach is cash withdrawal at an ATM.  Here, the money is only made available to the customer after they have removed their  card. In the industrial environment, the possibility of material removal for a work order  only after the previous insertion of a Kanban card is another example.

**4.2.3 Regulatory Mechanism**

The regulatory mechanism shows how the production system reacts due to errors or  incorrect actions. This function is divided into an intervention and steering method and  a warning approach. The intervention and steering method intervenes directly in the sys tem when an error or an incorrect action is detected and would—for example in indus 64 4 Poka Yoke

trial production—block the production. In the case of the intervention method, this is  to be subsumed under the hard Poka-Yoke methods. If the system does not intervene  despite an error, but the error is clearly communicated by the system (e.g., through an  acoustic, haptic and/or optical signal), this regulatory mechanism is defined as a warning  approach. An example of a haptic signal is a vibration.

For successful quality improvement, every element of the Poka-Yoke system must be  used in the implementation of the quality improvement measure. Comparable to the crea tivity technique of the morphological matrix, the Poka-Yoke system matrix is also used.  The solution finding of Poka Yoke is oriented towards the avoidance of incorrect actions.  For this, the specific process is analyzed by applying the Poka-Yoke system matrix (Fig.  4.2). By using creativity techniques, solutions for the causes of errors can be found in a  targeted manner. Prioritization for possible changes can be done by weighting the errors  via the Poka-Yoke priority number. The Poka-Yoke priority number is calculated as fol lows:

*Poka*\-*Yoke*\-*Priority Number* \=

*Probability of an Error Occurring* × *Significance of the Error*

× *Effort to correct Error*

Errors with a high priority number are treated as a priority. If there is a high effort to cor rect an error, this is weighted by a numerically high correction effort. Overall, the Poka Yoke system learns over the entire product life cycle and Poka-Yoke measures address  different levels of the product development cycle accordingly (Fig. 4.3). Furthermore, an  earlier avoidance of a cause of error is advantageous, but errors increasingly occur as the  product life cycle progresses.

For the analysis of activities, error probabilities play a significant role. Figure 4.4 shows relevant types of error actions for certain activities within a production.

**4.3 Workshop 7: “Reading and Puzzling”**

The susceptibility to errors of a task requiring care is to be illustrated using the reading  card attached in the appendix. The task is to correctly determine the number of the letter  “e” within the illustration. If this task is to be solved within a certain time, the suscepti bility to errors increases, all other things being equal. This again makes it clear that the  human factor represents a high source of error. Furthermore, it is questionable whether it  is possible to establish a routine within this task.

The avoidance of errors through appropriate process design is to be illustrated by  assembling a puzzle. However, the process example “Puzzle” (appendix) is character ized by the fact that all parts fit together—so also parts that do not belong together; this  greatly increases the number of potential errors. To document the process optimization,  the time, the problems that occurred, the number of errors, and suggestions for optimiza tion are documented (template blank form documentation).

For the first optimization of the process, a template with numbers could be created,  for example, and the puzzle pieces could also be numbered so that the pieces can be  placed in the corresponding fields. To ensure the correct positioning of the parts, either  the numbers themselves or corresponding parts can be used. 66 4 Poka Yoke

A second optimization can be achieved by implementing a self-check. In this case,  the typical cutouts of a puzzle are added to the parts, in addition to the template and the  numbers, so that the process (in se) ensures that the parts are correctly combined with  each other—since another combination is not possible (suggestion in the appendix). In  addition, the reliability of the process can be further increased by standardizing the order  in which the parts are provided. In this case, the process quality is greatly increased by  the possibility of finding a routine.
